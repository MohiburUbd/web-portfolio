                <p>Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for the look of the site. They are also responsible for the site’s technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website’s speed and how much traffic the site can handle. In addition, web developers may create content for the site.</p>

            <p>If you’re still interested by the time you decide if you’re going for a higher education, then no, Wix or Weebly should not at all concern you about a future in web design/development. It’s important to note that Wix and Weebly are more related to design than development, you aren’t really developing anything in them as such.</p>
